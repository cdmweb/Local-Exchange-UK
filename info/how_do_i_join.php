<p><b>Everyone who approaches with goodwill is welcome.</b></p>

<p>In order to join Fourth Corner Exchange you must do three things:</p>

<p>1. Attend a <a href="../news.php">New Members Meeting.</a> (No, you cannot just sign-up and start trading.)</p>

<p>2. Read, agree to and sign the <a href="agreement.php">Members Agreement.</a> This is a legally binding agreement and is enforcable in law. Read it carefully.</p>

<p>3. Offer at least one skill in the 
<a href="http://www.fourthcornerexchange.com/listings.php?type=Offer">Members Directory</a> to other members. Think about what you love doing, not just what you do to earn money. The local currency economies are far more varied, creative and stress-free than conventional money. Have fun.</p>


<p>We ask everyone who would like to join to attend a New Member Meeting, so that we can meet you, give you the opportunity to meet other prospective members, explain how we run Fourth Corner Exchange, and give you the opportunity to ask questions that you might have about Time Dollars. Membership forms will be available at the meeting for you to fill out. At this time there is no fee for joining, although in the future we may have a small fee to cover administrative costs.</p>

<p>Still have <a href="../contact.php">questions</a>?
