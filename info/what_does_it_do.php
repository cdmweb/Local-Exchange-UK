<p>Local currency enriches everyone within the network by connecting people 
to other people. It allows individuals to utilize talents which may be 
unrewarded by the cash economy. It builds community by putting a human 
face on our economic transactions. It is by its very nature local, and 
thus it promotes a sense of place and is responsive to the people and 
the needs of this unique corner of the globe.</p>
