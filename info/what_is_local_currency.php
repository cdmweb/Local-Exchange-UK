<p>You may have heard it called <strong>scrip</strong>, <strong>hours, a <em>LETS </em> system
    </strong>or <strong>Time Dollars</strong>. These are just some examples of
    the many local currency systems working around the world to foster goods
    and service exchange on the community level.</p>

<p>These complimentary currency systems are now being used all around the world
  in places like the United Kingdom, Southern Ireland, Germany, France, Australia,
  Holland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina, Canada and in many communities across the
  US. The recent expansion of local currency systems reflects a growing grassroots
  desire to create a more sustainable and humane world.</p>
<p>Local currencies are not new to the US. During the 1930's many communities
  created their own scrip in order to build local trading networks connecting
  people to the goods and services they needed. Scrips were powerful forces for
  good in those dark economic times when national currency was almost unobtainable
  for the average person.</p>

  <p align="left"><strong>&quot;Time Dollars empower any person to convert personal time into purchasing
      power - stretching limited cash dollars further and matching unused capacity
      with unmet demand. They reinforce reciprocity and trust. They reward civic
      engagement and acts of decency in a way that generates social capital, one
      hour at a time. They are bringing people together in communities all around
      the nation.&quot;</strong>
