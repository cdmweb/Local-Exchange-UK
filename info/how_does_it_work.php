<p>The Fourth Corner Exchange is a mutual-credit, time-dollar system. It supports 
a gift economy which is fundamentally different from a cash economy. The 
system is based on human capital - your skills and energies - and on trust.</p>

<p>Unlike the cash economy your capital is not restricted to the numbers on your
bank statement. So long as you have something to offer another person (and
everyone does), you have capital. Since participants don't need to compete
for scarce resources, it is a fundamentally cooperative trading endeavor.</p>

<p>The goods and services you can obtain are not limited to a single trading
partner, as with barter, but rather encompass the offerings of the entire trading
network. You can see the goods and services currently available in our <a href="http://www.fourthcornerexchange.com/listings.php?type=Offer" target="_blank">Members Directory</a>. You must become a member in order to trade. See <a href="how_do_i_join.php">How Do I Join</a> for information on joining Fourth Corner Exchange.</p>

<p>The possibilities are limited only by your imagination and energy.</p>
