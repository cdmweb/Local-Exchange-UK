<h1><center>Reading List</center></h1>

<h2><center>Alternative Economics</center></h2>

<p><em><b>The Grip of Death</b> - Michael Rowbotham [1998]</em><br>
<blockquote>A study of modern money, debt slavery and destructive economics. One of the best books ever written about what is wrong with our present money system. <strong>If you never read anything else on alternative economics, read this!</strong></blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>The Future of Money</b> - Bernard Lietaer [2001]</em><br>
<blockquote>Creating new wealth, work and a wiser world. A great introduction to local currencies worldwide. This book provides a road map for the monetary journey out of a decaying Industrial Age to an Information Age, where greater opportunities become available. It is also a discovery guide to the money system - the way money is created and managed in our society. (This book, published in 2001, is difficult to get hold of because it was originally scheduled to be published USA, but never was. Perhaps Bernard hit too close to the truth in his observations about the present money system we live within.)</blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>The Soul of Money</b> - Lynne Twist [2003]</em><br>
<blockquote>Transforming your relationship with money and life. This compelling and funamentally liberating book shows us that examining our attitude towards money - earning it, spending it, and giving it away - can offer surprising insight into our lives, our values, and the essence of prosperity.</blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>Your Money or Your Life</b> - Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin [1992]</em><br>
<blockquote>Transforming your relationship with money and achieving financial independence. A classic that has transformed many people's lives.</blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>Interest and Inflation Free Money</b> - Margrit Kennedy [1995]</em><br>
<blockquote>Creating an exchange medium that works for everybody and protects the earth. Interest free money! Think about that.</blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>LETS Work</b> - Peter Lang [1994]</em><br>
<blockquote>Rebuilding the local economy. An introduction to LETS in the UK.</blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>Time Dollars</b> - Edgar Cahn & Jonathan Rowe [1992]</em><br>
<blockquote>The new currency that enables Americans to turn their hidden resource - time - into personal security & community renewal. This is what Fourth Corner Exchange is about.</blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>The Growth Illusion</b> - Richard Douthwaite [1992]</em><br>
<blockquote>How economic growth has enriched the few, impoverished the many and endangered the planet.</blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>Short Circuit</b> - Richard Douthwaite [1997]</em><br>
<blockquote>Strengthening Local Economies for Security in an Unstable World. Douthwaite is an economist living in Ireland who has thoroughly researched the role of the global market in the dissolution of local communities as well as the role of local currencies in strengthening community. In this book he combines a scholarly and critical review of classical and alternative economics with a "how to" approach to setting up a local currency system. This is an excellent book for those interested in a "thought piece" on modern life as well as those who are seriously interested in exploring and creating alternative economies.</blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>The Cheating of America</b> - Charles Lewis & Bill Allison [2001]</em><br>
<blockquote>How tax avoidance and evasion by the super rich are costing the country billions - and what you can do about it.</blockquote></p>

<h2><center>Democracy & Globalisation</center></h2>

<p><em><b>Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</b> - John Perkins [2004]</em><br>
<blockquote>"Economic hit men," John Perkins writes, "are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. Their tools include fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, sex, and murder." John Perkins should know - he was an economic hit man. His job was to convince countries that are strategically important to the U.S. - from Indonesia to Panama - to accept enormous loans. Saddled with huge debts, these countries came under the control of the United States government, World Bank, and other U.S. dominated aid agencies that acted like loan sharks - dictating repayment terms and bullying foreign governments into submission.</blockquote></p>

How the nation had reached such a desperate situation and how it responded to the banking "holiday" are examined in this book.</blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>What Everybody Wants to Know About Money</b> - G.D.H. Cole [1933]</em><br>
<blockquote>A textbook on economics by an English economist, that actually explains in straight-forward language what money is, how our money system works, and why it need to be changed.</blockquote></p>

<p><em><b>The Breakdown of Money</b> - Christopher Hollis [1934]</em><br>
<blockquote>Explains how the banks create money out of nothing and then lend it to us at interest. Hollis has been ignored because he wrote the embarrasing truth about the money system, who creates money and how, and who benefits.</blockquote></p>
